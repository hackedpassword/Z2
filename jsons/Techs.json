	Tech notes:
	The foundation of this tech tree is G&K, though there are several huge differences now.
		1. Complete tree reshuffle. Very careful attention to rebuilding it.
		2. Two additional eras.
		3. Rebuilt minding logical progression, for ex. techs that previously were unsensibly out-of-order now restructured
	All G&K quotes are slated to be removed. Game notes and hints will guide the player instead.
