	/* Modchecker notes. As noted in Eras.json, while Z2 remains an extension mod, versus a base ruleset, there are some limitations to the tech tree.
		First, can't properly preceed the Ancient era with Prehistoric, so both are merged. Second, modchecker believes several techs here do not
		exist, yet the tech tree shows them and are gameplay accessible. Modchecker also complains about Galley, which appears to be an artifact of
		its belief that the required tech is absent. Only fix appears to be ascending Z2 to a base ruleset.
