Design Notes:

Z2 is not currently meant for random map generation and has (almost) all map-gen uniques removed. The Z2 Hyrule overworld is a static terrain.

Ruleset base originates in G&K. As dev progresses, more G&K will be gutted, Zelda 2 injected. Since this is my first ruleset mod, lots of experimenting.
Probably should make a -stable version of the mod. #todo make -stable Z2 version
	
You'll see this unique combo: <in [Friendly Land] tiles> <within [3] tiles of a [City center]> on most resources. Visually, this retains a super clean map presentation
by not spamming the landscape with resource icons. See Plains tile, more info there.

Most resources also have <with [X]% chance> because I am not guaranteeing per-tile resources.
The motivation here is per year(turn) conditions change, thus a resource may be more/less plentiful next year. 
Also, allows for bonus resources including rare bonuses, like Gold in grasslands (2% chance), or
stacking bonuses as seen in Caverns.

These mod checker warnings cannot currently be suppressed. All derive from hybrid tiles. 
	CoastTile turns into terrain Force which is not a base terrain!
	OceanTile turns into terrain Force which is not a base terrain!
	Bridge1ocean turns into terrain Force which is not a base terrain!
	Bridge2ocean turns into terrain Force which is not a base terrain!
	Bridge1coast turns into terrain Force which is not a base terrain!
	Bridge2coast turns into terrain Force which is not a base terrain!
	Bridge3coast turns into terrain Force which is not a base terrain!
	Bridge3 turns into terrain Force which is not a base terrain!
	BridgeFL occurs on natural wonder CoastTile: Unsupported.

	BridgeFR occurs on natural wonder CoastTile: Unsupported.

////  Z2 feature: dynmamic tile resources  ////
/*
	Base tiles provide scaling and dynamic resources that update per turn, *within city borders* and within workable distance ONLY. Static resources are intentionally absent.
	Auto-assigned pop will follow/reassign to selected resource Focus when turn starts, optimizing returns for that year.
		Meaning: You will ONLY see food, production, etc, resource icons:
		    + inside city borders
		    + in work range
		    + amounts per tile change every year (turn)
	This is quite useful in when pop is thin, as pop takes advantage of chance terrain resource peaks and bonuses.
	Resources will auto populate upon purchase of tile as chance dictates. Note, haxycheatx0rz, hitting Undo will regen terrain resources so it's possible to tilt the field.
