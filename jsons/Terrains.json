Design Notes:

Z2 is not currently meant for random map generation and has all map-gen uniques removed.

Ruleset base originates in G&K.
	
You'll see <within [3] tiles of a [City center]> on most resources.
Visually, this retains the clean presentation of the Z2 map by not spamming the landscape with resource icons. 

Most resources also have <with [X]% chance> because I am not guaranteeing per-tile resources.
The motivation here is per year(turn) conditions change, thus a resource may be more/less plentiful next year. 
Also, allows for bonus resources including rare bonuses, like Gold in grasslands (2% chance), or
stacking bonuses as seen in Caverns.

These mod checker warnings cannot currently be suppressed. All derive from hybrid tiles. 
	CoastTile turns into terrain Force which is not a base terrain!
	OceanTile turns into terrain Force which is not a base terrain!
	Bridge1ocean turns into terrain Force which is not a base terrain!
	Bridge2ocean turns into terrain Force which is not a base terrain!
	Bridge1coast turns into terrain Force which is not a base terrain!
	Bridge2coast turns into terrain Force which is not a base terrain!
	Bridge3coast turns into terrain Force which is not a base terrain!
	Bridge3 turns into terrain Force which is not a base terrain!
	BridgeFL occurs on natural wonder CoastTile: Unsupported.
	BridgeFL occurs on natural wonder OceanTile: Unsupported.
	BridgeFR occurs on natural wonder CoastTile: Unsupported.
