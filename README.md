# Z2 : Zelda 2 for Unciv

Looking for some NES nostalgia? With a Civ V twist? You’ve come to the right place.

This isn’t your normal Unciv map, or mod. Being that I’m a huge fan of the original Zelda 2, up to and including zero continue game completion, this is a project of great interest. For several reasons:

1. For the first time in Unciv history, bridge tiles can be placed. This is accomplished with “hybrid” tiles, invented here.
2. Thanks to hybrid tiles, three specific Zelda 2 gameplay elements have been preserved: raft crossing, boot water walking, and the bridge to Maze Island.
3. Unciv modder/mappers are going to have a field day tearing apart Z2! Have at it! Share what you learned, this is a huge opportunity!

There’s a write up on [Hybrid Tile Tech](HybridTileTech.md) revealing how this bridge madness works.

## Game notes

First and foremost, this is an experimental, unbalanced, first release demo. There’s still a lot to do to get the correct intended gameplay.

The initial aesthetics are intact. All places, power-ups, bonuses, etc are as-is in a very detailed interpretation of the original Zelda game. Converting from square tiles to hex tiles is challenging, but the challenge was met!

The map was built with purists in mind. Take Maze Island for instance. I'm constantly looking for accuracy tweaks. Hey, there's one now!

Bringing Unciv elements to Z2 was interesting. I have managed to effectively crossover both games. More work is needed, especially once improvements are created.

Unit/terrain bonuses/uniques are a bit haphazard atm. It’s enough to get this map-mod off the ground for now.

## Modder notes

Feel free to review the json’s. Lots can be removed and lots more to do. Definitely need to prune unused config blocks.

In the future I’ll be moving the image assets over to my assets repo to reduce the mod size.

There will probably be a discord channel for this map. Comment there. Would like to hear your feedback.
