# Z2 : Zelda 2 for Unciv

Looking for some NES nostalgia? With a Civ V twist? You’ve come to the right place.

I’m a huge fan of the original Zelda 2, up to and including no-lives-lost vanila game completion. I also have a [less than 7 minute completion speedrun time](https://youtu.be/uHrhG_AkObw) which you may find entertaining. ;) 

## Z2 achievements:

1. For the first time in Unciv history, bridge tiles can be placed. This is accomplished with [Hybrid Tile Tech](HybridTileTech.md), invented here, and now [mentioned in Unciv's code](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv/blob/11108112b513da41fe80875c01332650455f1196/core/src/com/unciv/models/ruleset/validation/RulesetValidator.kt#L352).
2. Thanks to hybrid tiles, three specific Zelda 2 gameplay elements have been preserved: raft crossing, boot water walking, and the bridge to Maze Island.
3. Unciv modder/mappers are going to have a field day tearing apart Z2! Have at it! Share what you learned, this is a huge opportunity!

Take a closer look at the above and you'll see the **hidden water paths** using [Force](https://github.com/hackedpassword/Z2/blob/a28fc4ceebfa023fb7481dfcedd35cacc9fe58d3/jsons/Terrains.json#L282) (a TerrainFeature) via [customized ocean Hybrid tiles](https://github.com/hackedpassword/Z2/blob/a28fc4ceebfa023fb7481dfcedd35cacc9fe58d3/jsons/Terrains.json#L791) that makes the special features of the Hyrule overworld map possible!

Feel free to review/reuse the json’s. There's tons of commentary, especially towards learning what Unciv can/can't do.
