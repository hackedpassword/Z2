# Z2 : Zelda 2 for Unciv

Looking for some NES nostalgia? With a Civ V twist? You’ve come to the right place.

I’m a huge fan of the original Zelda 2, up to and including no-lives-lost game completion.

### Z2 has some notable achievements:

1. For the first time in Unciv history, bridge tiles can be placed. This is accomplished with [Hybrid Tile Tech](HybridTileTech.md), invented here.
2. Thanks to hybrid tiles, three specific Zelda 2 gameplay elements have been preserved: raft crossing, boot water walking, and the bridge to Maze Island.
3. Unciv modder/mappers are going to have a field day tearing apart Z2! Have at it! Share what you learned, this is a huge opportunity!

Take a closer look at the above, and you'll see the hidden water paths using Force (TerrainFeature) via hybrid tiles! 

## Game notes

Release 8 is now available! (v0.8)

In release 8, you'll now find:

- Workers are original Villagers, and change their form every era!
- WMD's and new GDR's for late/end games
- Deep Ocean creates soft clips where areas of vast ocean has no gameplay
- Towns and Palaces are properly named per the originals
- Tile add/updates: Cavern, Forest, Kasuto Ruins
- Villagers can build Boulders
- Rivers are now called Lava
- Lots of config tweaks/bug fixes

Palaces provide a powerup for scaling the mountainous landscape to adjacent land units, which will later be refined and aligned to each palaces' unique item. Towns will undergo the same treatment, currently healing units while granting non-military promotions.

All places, power-ups, bonuses, etc are found as expected in a very detailed interpretation of the original Zelda 2 game. Converting from square tiles to hex tiles was challenging, but the challenge was met!

The map was built with purists in mind. Take Maze Island for instance. Super challenging to make an approximation of the paths within the constraints of the scale.

Bringing Unciv elements to Z2 was interesting. I have managed to effectively crossover both games. More work is needed, especially once improvements are created.

## Modder notes

Feel free to review/reuse the json’s. Ask questions in discord. I've gained a lot of experience implementing hybrid tiles.

In the future I’ll be moving the ./image/ assets over to my [assets repo](https://github.com/hackedpassword/Unciv-Assets/images/Z2/) to reduce the mod size and build the atlas as needed.

Comment in the [discord](https://discord.com/channels/586194543280390151/1138883296835682324) channel. Would like to hear your feedback.
