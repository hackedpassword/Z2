# Z2 : Zelda 2 for Unciv

Looking for some NES nostalgia? With a Civ V twist? You’ve come to the right place.

This isn’t your normal Unciv map, or mod. Being that I’m a huge fan of the original Zelda 2, up to and including zero continue game completion, this is a project of great interest. For several reasons:

1. For the first time in Unciv history, bridge tiles can be placed. This is accomplished with “hybrid” tiles, invented here.
2. Thanks to hybrid tiles, three specific Zelda 2 gameplay elements have been preserved: raft crossing, boot water walking, and the bridge to Maze Island.
3. Unciv modder/mappers are going to have a field day tearing apart Z2! Have at it! Share what you learned, this is a huge opportunity!

There’s a write up on [Hybrid Tile Tech](HybridTileTech.md) revealing how this bridge madness works.

Take a closer look at the above, and you'll see the hidden water paths using Force (TerrainFeature) via hybrid tiles!

## Game notes

Fifth release, see [discord](https://discord.com/channels/586194543280390151/1138883296835682324) for release notes.

This mod/etention is still experimental, a lot to do to get the correct intended gameplay, but it does play well!

Game aesthetics are intact. All places, power-ups, bonuses, etc are as-is in a very detailed interpretation of the original Zelda game. Converting from square tiles to hex tiles is challenging, but the challenge was met! Approximation is an art. I'm constantly looking for accuracy tweaks.

The map was built with purists in mind. Take Maze Island for instance. Super challenging to make this approximation within the constraints of the scale.

Bringing Unciv elements to Z2 was interesting. I have managed to effectively crossover both games. More work is needed, especially once improvements are created.

Unit/terrain bonuses/uniques are a bit haphazard atm. Palaces provide a general powerup to any adjacent land unit, to be refined and aligned to each palaces' unique item. Towns will undergo the same.

## Modder notes

Feel free to review/reuse the json’s. Ask questions in discord. I've gained a lot of experience implementing hybrid tiles.

In the future I’ll be moving the ./image/ assets over to my [assets repo](https://github.com/hackedpassword/Unciv-Assets/images/Z2/) to reduce the mod size and build the atlas as needed.
